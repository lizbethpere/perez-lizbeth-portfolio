# Final Project Part III


## Final Reflections 
For Part II of the final project, I created a PowerPoint as an outline of what I wanted Part III to look like. 
I think this approach was good in the sense that it allowed me to be creative with the theme and identify the feel I wanted to create. 
I do regret using that method because it slowed down my progress with Part III. I think I should have spent more time creating more impactful data 
visualizations to tell my story. I think I focused too much on what I wanted to talk about that I did not allocate enough time to find data that 
I could use it to create visualizations. 

I identified my audience to be people familiar with evictions or housing policies. It was challenging to put my presentation together taking into consideration my classmates. 
I know a lot of them might not be familiar with evictions so I tried to only include the most important parts and avoid topics that might be difficult to understand without prior background. 
When I talked with friends about my presentation, they also recommended that I narrow down my topic and include an impactful story at the beginning of my presentation to show the importance of evictions. 
This was difficult for me because there are so many factors that go into evictions. In the end, I decided to talk mainly about Nebraska. I was aware that a lot of people in my audience might not be familiar with Nebraska, 
but it was important for me to talk about it because I live there, and it impacts my community. To address my classmates, I decided to first provide general information about evictions in the U.S. and then talk about how they 
can also help their communities to address displacement caused by evictions. 

Although I had in mind a specific audience, comments by classmates and professors helped me see that I still need to make my presentation readable to everyone and make it easy to understand. So, I decided to include a brief introduction 
in my presentation about what evictions are and how they work. 

The design decisions that I made were mainly to have a theme that reflects sad homes. When people lose their homes or places, they have lived for a long time, they tend to lose important belongings and memories. So, I wanted to give it a sad feeling. 
I also decided to start my project with a story and then talk about general information about evictions in the country and how the pandemic has increased evictions. After this section, I talked about Nebraska and how they are approaching evictions in the state. 
I was surprised at the lack of recent data about this topic but at the same time, it makes sense. A lot of states were not tracking evictions during the pandemic and others are tracking formal evictions, not informal ones. For my visualizations, 
I tried to include all the necessary information for anyone to understand them. I decided to use colors that were easy to understand and that stand out from the overall presentation. I liked the features available in Infogram but to my surprise, 
I was not able to download them because I needed a subscription. I had to take screenshots of the graphics and visualization which I did not like because I wanted the visualization to be interactive. In the end, I asked friends to look over my work 
one more time and to my surprise they liked it. I think I needed to add more visualizations to make it more impactful. I am still happy with how I was able to put my story together. I think with all the feedback provided, my presentation is now easy to navigate and understand.
