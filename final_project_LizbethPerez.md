# Final Project Part I

## Outline

Summary of project: For my project, I am interested in showing the growing number of evictions in the country, the way government officials are addressing this problem, the implications of evictions in communities, and what actions are needed to address this issue. This is with the purpose of informing the audience and hopefully motivating them to take action. 

Setup: We all know that evictions in the country are increasing. 
Conflict: Evictions affect families in multiple ways and the people involved in the process. 
Resolution: A universal voucher housing system will help solve this problem.

## Method and Medium 

I will complete my project using Shorthand. By looking at the presentations in class, I think it makes sense to use it as it provides an easy way to show complex information. I think Shorthand will allow me to be more creative about how I present my topic. Additionally, I plan to use Tableau and Flourish to create the visualizations I need for my project.
