# Final Project Part I

## Outline

Summary of project: For my project, I am interested in showing the growing number of evictions in the country, the way government officials are addressing this problem, the implications of evictions in communities, and what actions are needed to address this issue. This is with the purpose of informing the audience and hopefully motivating them to take action. 

Setup: We all know that evictions in the country are increasing. 
Conflict: Evictions affect families in multiple ways and the people involved in the process. 
Resolution: A universal voucher housing system will help solve this problem.

## Datasets

- Nebraska is debating about applying for additional funds for rent-eviction relief. I plan to use this information to show how some states in the country that have access to rent-eviction relief do not use it. The Governor of Nebraska mentioned in a recent interview that they will not apply for relief because Nebraska doesn't need it.

- UNL project focused on reducing and assisting families with evictions. This article talks about a unique initiative the University of Nebraska Lincoln school of law started to reduce evictions in Lincoln, Nebraska. I will use this article to show how small initiatives can reduce evictions and increase permanent home ownership.

- Adequacy of housing policies in response to COVID-19 pandemic in the United States as of May 2021, by state. This was obtained from Statista, and I plan to use it in the set-up part of the project to show the impact of COVID-19 in evictions.

## Method and Medium 

I will complete my project using Shorthand. By looking at the presentations in class, I think it makes sense to use it as it provides an easy way to show complex information. I think Shorthand will allow me to be more creative about how I present my topic. Additionally, I plan to use Tableau and Flourish to create the visualizations I need for my project.
