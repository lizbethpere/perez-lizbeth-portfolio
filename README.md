# perez-lizbeth-portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling stories with data at CMU! 

# About me 
I'm exited to share all the work that I will create in my course Telling stories with data. This is my first time taking a course related to data visualization so I'm exited to acquire new skills and new strategies to better present information with visualizations. Please look forward to my work!  

# What I hope to learn 
I hope to learn how to better present data with visualizations to a wide audience. It's really important for me to find ways to better communicate with audiences that have specific needs. I think the results will be meanigful and applicable to different settings and situations.
