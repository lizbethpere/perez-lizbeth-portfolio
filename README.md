# perez-lizbeth-portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling stories with data at CMU! 

# About me 
I'm exited to share all the work that I will create in my course Telling stories with data. This is my first time taking a course related to data visualization so I'm exited to acquire new skills and new strategies to better present information with visualizations. Please look forward to my work!  

# What I hope to learn 
I hope to learn how to better present data with visualizations to a wide audience. It's really important for me to find ways to better communicate with audiences that have specific needs. I think the results will be meanigful and applicable to different settings and situations.

This is the place where I will share all of my work and final project.

## Grid of Line Charts

These graphs look at different countries's general government ratio from 1995 to 2019.

General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. 
It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. 
Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable.

## Third Data Visualization

These graphs look at different countries's general government ratio from 1995 to 2019.

I decided to use a Column Chart (grouped) for my third visualization because it allows readers to easily identify countries of interest and easily identify the y and x axis. With the general Debt Bar Chart it can be difficult to identify a country easily. It also highlights only a few countries that do not necessarily tell important information to the reader. The Grid of Line Chart does a good job identifying each country easily and allows readers to compare. However, the color red might not be the best color choice for color-blind readers. The Third Data Visualization takes all care of all these concerns by using a blue color and bars to easily compare countries. A person unfamiliar with the government debt ratio will easily understand what is being compared.
