These graphs look at different countries's general government ratio from 1995 to 2019.

General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. 
It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. 
Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable.
