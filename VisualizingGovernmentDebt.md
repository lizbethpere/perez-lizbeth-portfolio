## Part 2: Working with Flourish

These graphs look at different countries' general government ratios from 1995 to 2019.
The general government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions, standardized guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable.

## Third Data Visualization

These graphs look at different countries's general government ratio from 1995 to 2019.

I decided to use a Column Chart (grouped) for my third visualization because it allows readers to identify countries of interest and identify the y and x-axis. With the general Debt Bar Chart, it can be difficult to identify a country. It also highlights only a few countries that do not necessarily tell important information to the reader. The Grid of Line Chart does a good job identifying each country easily and allows readers to compare. However, the color red might not be the best color choice for color-blind readers. The Third Data Visualization takes care of all these concerns by using a blue color and bars to easily compare countries. A person unfamiliar with the government debt ratio will easily understand what is being compared.
