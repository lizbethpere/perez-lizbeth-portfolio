# Part II Final Project 

## Draft 
I used PowerPoint to lay out my work before I start using Shorthand. This method allowed me to create a strong story, include only necessary information, and find the theme I was to use in my presentation. PowerPoint was an easy way for me to lay out my ideas.

## Interview Findings

For my interviews, I decided to interview people without a background in Public Policy. I wanted to see if they might be able to understand the information without prior education about the topic. To my surprise, some of them were familiar with the topic, but others were not. Some of them told me that the story was easy to follow and that including an impactful story at the beginning would set the tone for the entire presentation. They said that the colors showed the impact of the topic.  For Part III of the project, I will use the same theme. Some of the people that I interview mentioned that it was hard to understand how income affects people and influences evictions. To avoid confusion, I will spend more time in this section to make it easier to understand. I will also do additional research about particular states to narrow down my topic since evictions are related to other issues.
